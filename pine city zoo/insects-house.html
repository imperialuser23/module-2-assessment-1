                <h3>INSECT-HOUSE</h3>
                <P>We can all agree that bugs belong outside—but they somehow always make their way into an indoor crack or crevice you werent expecting. And when they do, spotting one in your home is well, not fun, no matter how big or small the critter is. The good news is: Most common house bugs wont harm you. In fact, theyre likely more afraid of you than you are of them. Still, its nice to know what they are and what their intentions could be during their stay in your humble abode.

                    You may notice more insects lurking about during a major season change, after a heavy rain sets in, or if you have food lying around—and even though most of bugs shouldnt concern you, you dont necessarily want to cuddle up with them at night. (Bed bugs, though? Those, you should definitely be concerned about.)
                    
                    So, we turned to several entomologists and pest control experts to help us round up a list of creepy crawlers you can find living in—or passing through—your home. From invasive species like stink bugs to weird-looking wolf spiders to brightly-colored beetles, here are the most common house bugs to know, how to identify them, and whether or not you should worry if you spot one. Just remember that we share this Earth with all kinds of creatures, and they just happen to be the (mostly harmless) ones that give us the heebie jeebies. They cant help it!

                    Lady Bird Beetle (a.k.a. Ladybugs)
                    lady bird beetle - ladybug
                    What it looks like: Youre probably very familiar with this one. Ladybugs are tiny, oval, winged beetles that are usually between 1 to 10 millimeters (mm) in length, depending on the species. They are typically bright red with black spots.
                    
                    Where youll find it: You can find them in your home in autumn between September through November, when the temperatures drop and they seek a warm spot for winter. They like to gather together within crevices, like cracks around windows and door frames, soffits, attics, wall voids, and the area behind fascia boards and exterior siding.
                    
                    Can it harm you? These beetles are believed to trigger allergies, ranging from eye irritation to asthma, potentially because they emit a stinky, yellow secretion when they feel theyre in danger. Lady bird beetles also can bite (it feels like a pinch), but they are not poisonous and are rarely harmful.</p>
